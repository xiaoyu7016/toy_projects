# Danganronpa V3 favorite character analysis from one Steam post
Just finished Danganronpa V3 and wanted to see what other players feel about the characters.

## Scope (might expand)
1. Scrape the post on favorite characters from Steam (check)
2. Rank the most mentioned characters (check)

   a. Get a fancy bar char with character avartars on the axis (check)  
   b. Normalize the names and re-run 2.
3. Break down each bar with positive/negative comments.
4. It would be interesting to visually compare US and Japanese polarity

5. Probably scrape Reddit as well?
6. Could use scatter plot matrix to understand sentiment correlation (people who like kokichi also like kiyo?)
7. Can use word2vec to vectorize each character? Would tSNE graph help visualize?
8. Analyze & visualize co-occurence.
