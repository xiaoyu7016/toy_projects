# Danganronpa V3 favorite character analysis from one Steam post
Just finished Danganronpa V3 and wanted to see what other players feel about the characters.

## Scope (might expand)
1. Scrape the post on favorite characters from Steam (check)
2. Rank the most mentioned characters (check)

   a. Get a fancy bar char with character avartars on the axis (check)  
   b. Kib's low mention might be caused by too many variations of his name
3. Break down each bar with positive/negative comments.
4. It would be interesting to visually compare US and Japanese polarity

5. Probably scrape Reddit as well?
