Sure his idiocy can be a bit grating at times, but he more than makes up for it by showing just how much of a genuinely good guy and good influence he is. Can't go to specifics without spoilers, but if you played to the end you know what I mean. </blockquote>"

She's rude/brash, but she means well and it seems as if she's pretty lonely too. And it's hilarious that she's actually so wimpy. It makes her cute. If she didn't have the wimpy side she would have been a lot more annoying, I think.<br/><br/><span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>Also, she actually is the one that does the most with her talent out of all the danganronpa games.

Maki: I like how innocent she can be despite being an <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>assassin</span></span>. She likes reading manga as well as sweets and I find that really cute!<br/>2. Kokichi: I hate the guy for doing what he did <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>to Gonta and Kaito</span></span> but he's a well written character, obviously intelligent! Despite his malicious behavior in the game, he doesn't like killing anyone and enjoys the police.<br/>3. Korekiyo: You can't find a better passionate character than him in this batch. He's also just as intelligent, I personally love aura that he emits. <br/>4. Himiko: She acts like a 10 year old and doesn't seem like a high school student at all but she's so innocent, it's hard NOT to like her. Sure, she can be lazy but that's not anything to be too concerned about and there are others with worse traits. <br/>5. Kaito: Do I have to say? He's positive and would much rather look on the bright side. He's a good friend to Shuichi as well as Maki and he wants to make everyone feel good and considers their feelings and troubles in order to help his friends gain confidence. </blockquote>"

I guess I keep just coming back to that assumption because other's often refered to with he/him pronouns with Keebo and they're found on the boys side in the dorm/handbook. Well Keebo is by far my favorite robot, and I guess next to him, Ryoma is my favorite boy(?) To be honest, I liked all the boys in this game, but none of them really intrest me that much other than Rantaro and Keebo is just so good and perfect so obviously I love them. Ryoma's cool though, very interesting and not at all who I thought he would be. </blockquote>"

Since rantaro seems to be a cool guy, chill and stuff. Kokichi remind me of a little too energic brother who can't express himself the way he want because he have too much older brothers and have to be the little crap of the familly to have some attention. Well i'm not really wrong for that i think. But through the game i have two more good character to add. First saihara, i didn't have a catch for his design but he have this ""little"" thing as a playable that i found in Hajime (sorry makoto your a blank plank). Also last favorite is Gonta. Why? Well.. GONTA GENTLEMAN. How you cannot like him, he is such a cutie.<br/><br/>But pleade.. why Angie, why you made her so horribly annoying. </blockquote>"

Korekiyo (although he's dark and dramatic), Angie (although she's kinda fun), Kokichi (although he's mysterious) and Gonta (although he's such a sweetheart) are characters I just can't connect with for one reason or the other and that's why I don't like them as much, compared to the others. </blockquote>"

I'm not sure if that's fair.

Because I really liked <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>Sonia and Kazuichi</span></span> and both of them survived. I still liked them at the end.<br/>In V3 my favorites from the start were <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>Kirumi and Kiibo</span></span>.

I thoroughly enjoyed <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>Himiko's character development throughout the game. The only thing I dislike is that she was still forcefully talking about her magic until the end, while it would've been better in my opinion if she shed that character trait after chapter 2 (with her trick being exposed and her coming to terms with magic not being real etc.).[/quote]<br/>She knows <span class=""bb_spoiler""><span>her magic is fake. She's not an idiot. The reason she does that is to preserve the magic in it. Just like ""Guys, it's totally magic, please don't think deeper into it or you'll ruin the fun"".??????like that.</span></span></span></span></blockquote>"
